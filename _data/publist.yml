  image: acc24_depreciation.png
  description: Dispatch of a grid energy storage system for arbitrage is typically formulated into a rolling-horizon optimization problem that includes a battery aging model within the cost function. Quantifying degradation as a depreciation cost in the objective can increase overall profits by extending lifetime. However, depreciation is just a proxy metric for battery aging; it is used because simulating the entire system life is challenging due to computational complexity and the absence of decades of future data. In cases where the depreciation cost does not match the loss of possible future revenue, different optimal usage profiles result and this reduces overall profit significantly compared to the best case (e.g., by 30–50%). Representing battery degradation perfectly within the rollinghorizon optimization does not resolve this—in addition, the economic cost of degradation throughout life should be carefully considered. For energy arbitrage, optimal economic dispatch requires a trade-off between overuse, leading to high return rate but short lifetime, vs. underuse, leading to a long but not profitable life. We reveal the intuition behind selecting representative costs for the objective function, and propose a simple moving average filter method to estimate degradation cost. Results show that this better captures peak revenue, assuming reliable price forecasts are available.

- title: "Taking the long view on short-run marginal emissions: how much carbon does flexibility and energy storage save?"
  image: OOE.png
  description: Grid-scale electricity storage will play a crucial role in the transition of power systems towards zero carbon. During the transition, investments need to be channeled towards technologies and locations that enable zero carbon operation in the long term, while also delivering security of supply and value for money. We discuss metrics and market signals that are needed to guide this transition towards clean, secure and affordable solutions. Paradoxically, carbon metrics play an important role, but become less effective as a decision tool once the system approaches zero carbon. We critically assess the role of marginal and average emission and question the allocation of marginal emissions in systems where combinations of renewables and storage deliver flexibility. We conclude that, for strategic investments, short-term market signals may not always deliver sufficiently fast or far-sighted outcomes and operational decisions need to consider the merit order of demand as well as supply.

- title: "Puddle formation, persistent gaps, and non-mean-field breakdown of superconductivity in overdoped (Pb,Bi)2Sr2CuO6+δ"
  image: BSCCOgap.png
  description: Why does cuprate superconductivity break down at a certain doping level? Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy we find that an emerging metallic matrix inside the superconducting state is responsible for the overall reduction of Tc and the superfluid density, while leaving the gapsize unchanged. The formation of the matrix is tied to a pair breaking process violating a core principle of mean-field theories.

  description: We use our atomic-scale scanning tunneling noise setup on a disordered superconductor, and discover a state above TC that, much like an ordinary metal, has no (pseudo)gap, but carries charge via paired electrons.

  image: TBG_SL.png
  description: Why is there so much variation in TBG devices? And are open devices more disordered than encapsulated ones? We introduce a new method to continuously map inhomogeneities of a moiré lattice and apply it to open-device TBG to show that twist angle variation is small over areas of hundreds of nm.
