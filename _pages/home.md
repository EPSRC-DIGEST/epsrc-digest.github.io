# Welcome to the DIGEST project!  

Welcome to our research project 'DIGEST' (**D**ata-driven exploration of the carbon emissions **I**mpact of **G**rid **E**nergy **ST**orage deployment and dispatch), funded by UKRI/EPSRC, a collaboration between Oxford University, Imperial College London, and Brunel University. This project explores how grid energy storage systems impact the carbon dioxide emissions from the power system.

# Summary

DIGEST focuses on integration of grid energy storage. Specifically, it aims to demonstrate the carbon emissions savings possible by optimally locating and operating storage to avoid curtailment of renewables and additional fossil fuel generation. Energy storage can provide many benefits to the power grid, and it is projected that [substantial storage will be required to meet UK net-zero targets](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/energy-futures-lab/reports/white-papers/net-zero-gb-electricity/#:~:text=This%20White%20Paper%20from%20the,electricity%20system%20for%20Great%20Britain.). However, it is not clear whether the financial and environmental advantages of storage currently align (e.g. if storage is placed far from excess renewable generation, on the other side of a congested network.).

This project aims to test two hypotheses:

1. that carbon emission benefits occur if the location-specific impacts of storage during dispatch are accounted for;
2. that optimal placement of storage in the network enables substantially accelerated deployment of clean energy generators.
To test these, we are developing novel GB transmission grid and market models, and simulate two scenario groups: First, what are the emissions impacts of existing and soon-to-be-built storage, and how could emissions be reduced? Second, how will emissions evolve over the next 15 years considering planned generation, storage, upgrades, and new demand.
