# Welcome!

Data-driven exploration of the carbon emissions impact of grid energy storage deployment and dispatch

EPSRC funded collaboration between Universities of Oxford and Edinburgh and Imperial College London

# Summary

DIGEST focuses on integration of grid energy storage. Specifically, it aims to demonstrate the carbon emissions savings possible by optimally locating and operating storage to avoid curtailment of renewables and additional fossil fuel generation. Energy storage can provide many benefits to the power grid, and it is projected that substantial storage will be required to meet UK net-zero targets (Aunedi 2021). However, it is not clear whether the financial and environmental advantages of storage currently align (e.g., if storage is placed far from excess renewable generation, on the other side of a congested network).

This project aims to test two hypotheses:

that carbon emission benefits occur if the location-specific impacts of storage during dispatch are accounted for;
that optimal placement of storage in the network enables substantially accelerated deployment of clean energy generators.
To test these, we will develop novel GB transmission grid and market models, and simulate two scenario groups: First, what are the emissions impacts of existing and soon-to-be-built storage, and how could emissions be reduced? Second, how will emissions evolve over the next 15 years considering planned generation, storage, upgrades, and new demand.

**News: Our group will move to the University of Oxford (OXF)!** During the next two years, and we will slowly move our instruments to Munich. We will be looking for PhD students, sub-group leaders, postdocs, engineering/technical stuff, and an administrative assistant. Please contact me if you are interested.
More details to follow.

We are a dynamic research group, at the [Battery Intelligence Lab](https://howey.eng.ox.ac.uk/). Our aim is to explore and understand quantum materials, including strange metals, high-temperature superconductors, and quantum critical electron matter. To this end, we develop new quantum sensing and quantum imaging instrumentation to get the key quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. We want to be able to build the perfect instruments to answer the scientific questions we deem most important (see [Research](research)). 


We are very much looking forward to being part of [Battery Intelligence Lab](https://howey.eng.ox.ac.uk/)! We will build up our instruments right in the center of the city, in the “Sommerfeldkeller”, where Sommerfeld himself worked. We will exchange ideas with world class groups working in quantum physics, cold-atom many-body physics, and 2d quantum materials.

Our move to Oxford will likely start around Summer 2024, depending on the state of renovations. 

Currently, we are located at Oxford University, the birthplace of superconductivity and home to Kamerlingh Onnes, Lorentz, Huygens, Einstein, de Sitter, and others (see e.g. [the wall of signatures from Ehrenfest lecturers](https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/history/colloquium/muur_heel.html)). 

We are grateful for funding from Oxford University,[EPSRC Grant EP/W027321/1](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/W027321/1).

 **We are  looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master students to join the team** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies) **!**
